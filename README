This project contains emacs/elisp utilities for working with Jekyll
projects.

Sample usage/configuration is (.emacs):

(require 'jekyll-launch)
(global-set-key "\C-cjl" 'jekyll-launch)
(global-set-key "\C-cjs" 'jekyll-launch-server)
(global-set-key "\C-cjk" 'jekyll-launch-kill-server)
(global-set-key "\C-cjn" 'jekyll-launch-new-post)

It is still in early stages of development.
